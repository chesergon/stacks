Introduction
A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in various applications, including function call management, expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and more.

Key Concepts
1.Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2.Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
3.Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Stack Implementation in JavaScript
JavaScript does not have a built-in stack data structure, but it can be easily implemented using arrays. Here's a simple implementation of a stack using JavaScript:


       
Conclusion
Stacks are a simple yet powerful data structure that can be efficiently implemented in JavaScript using arrays. Understanding and using stacks can significantly enhance your problem-solving skills in various domains such as algorithms, system design, and application development.

For more advanced usage, you can extend the Stack class to include additional functionalities or optimizations as needed.
